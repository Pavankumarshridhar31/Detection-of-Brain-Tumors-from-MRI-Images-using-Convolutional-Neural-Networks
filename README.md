This project focuses on developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately detect brain tumors from MRI images. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and data augmentation, the model aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and assist in identifying tumors with high precision. The project includes training, validation, and performance evaluation to ensure robustness and reliability in real-world applications.
